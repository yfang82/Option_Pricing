In this project, I will analyze and reproduce the iterative method purposed in the paper A Simple Iterative Method for the Valuation of American Options. The method was derived from the Black-Scholes model and Little et al. (2000)â€™s idea of representing the value of American option (put) with European option of the same underlying asset and a single integral involving the exercise boundary. By estimating the Exercise Boundary using iterative numerical method, the option value can be easily calculated.
After reproducing the iterative method, I compare it with the commonly used Binomial Tree method for option pricing. Then, I used the AAPL put option real-world example to examine the effectiveness of the two option pricing methods.
